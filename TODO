TODO

- Make the code more robust: handle several start requests without stop
  in-between, and vice-versa.

- When recording, show confirmation dialog when trying to close the window.

- Display an icon or label to know when it is recording.

- Be able to use the upstream libcheese: add API to change the
  GstEncodingProfile. But first see if there is already a way to do it with the
  current API.
