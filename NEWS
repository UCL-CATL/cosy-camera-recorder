* Copy the code of libcheese, to be able to modify it for our needs. Remove the
  classes that we don't need, and remove some features from CheeseCamera, to
  have less code (and thus easier to understand). Note that at this point the
  modifications of libcheese are just code removal, the videos are still
  encoded in the wrong format.

* Use the libcheese. The image of the camera is displayed in a GTK+ window, and
  starting/stopping video recordings with ZeroMQ requests work fine, except
  that the video is not encoded in the good format for Pupil Capture.

  Cheese is the GNOME webcam application, to take photos and videos, and apply
  effects. In cosy-camera-recorder we don't need to take photos nor apply
  effects, but the libcheese provides a convenient API, and it can be
  integrated into a GTK+ application. Unfortunately the libcheese was not
  developed as a "generic" shared library, a lot of the code is specific to the
  Cheese application (the use of GSettings inside the library, the hard-coded
  video format, things like that).
